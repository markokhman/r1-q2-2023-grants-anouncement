We are pleased to announce TON Foundationâ€™s approved grant recipients for Round 1 of Q2 2023!

The approved grant projects will bring significant value to TON by improving visibility of TON-based applications and Jettons, enabling on-chain lending, providing on-chain contract management and performance monitoring, introducing user-friendly use cases for TON core services, and exposing Toncoin (TON) to a large mobile audience through a TON wallet integration with KaiOS.

TON wallet on KaiOS will enable users of low specs phones working on KaiOS (3rd Largest Mobile Operating System). KaiOS brings the best of smartphones to affordable devices. Audience accessing this OS are mostly first-time internet users from Asia, Africa and South America.

Additionally, a **content viewing service** will be launched with support for documents, books and basic videos from TON Storage, along with the indexing of Storage bags for search purposes.

**[Monitoning Platform](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?isRenderingProposalBody=true&chainId=10&proposalId=0x275&grantId=0xe92b011b2ecb97dbe168c802d582037e28036f9b)** - the first **TON smart contract monitoring application** will allow users to create projects, add contracts, and view all messages passed through the project contracts along with analytics. The project involves developing a solution to decode message bodies from bytecode to a readable form, similar to the ABI add-on in Dune Analytics/Tenderly.
